Interesting android app for kids to know our world .
The app is called "Know our World" on PlayStore 

When any location is clicked it says someinteresting info about the country - its capital / currency etc.
For United states - it drills down details upto the states with trivia on each state
It also displays a pop-up info window with the corresponding flag of the country 

It's also my first app with google map apis and it was really exciting .
